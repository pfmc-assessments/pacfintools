#' Aggregate length, age, or age-at-length composition data by strata
#'
#' `getComps()` first sets up the local environment and returns summaries by
#' groupings.
#'
#' @details
#' This function uses the expansions created in [getExpansion_1()] and
#' [getExpansion_2()] using `"weightid"`. Thus, whatever column name is passed
#' to `weightid` will be used as the weight for each group. See the
#' documentation for the pass-through arguments, i.e., `...`
#'
#' @inheritParams tableSample
#' @inheritParams cleanPacFIN
#' @param Comps The type of composition data to create. See the function call
#'   for the available options. The first option listed is the default, which
#'   creates conditional age-at-length compositions by adding both `lengthcm`
#'   and `Age` to the grouping structure.
#' @param defaults The default stratification columns which will typically be
#'   left at their default value of `c("fleet", "fishyr", "season")`.
#' @param towid A vector of character values providing the column names that
#'   generate a unique id for each sample. The default is `"SAMPLE_NO"` but you
#'   can pass a vector where all of the columns identified will be united to
#'   create a unique identifier for the tow/sample.
#' @param weightid A character value giving the column name that holds the value
#'   to be summed for each type and strata, such as `weightid =
#'   "Final_Sample_Size_L"`, if you are interested in length data. Instead of
#'   the default, you might want to weight each stratification by the final
#'   sample sizes found for age data, i.e., `weightid = "Final_Sample_Size_A"`.
#'   You can pass `weightid` any column that exists in `Pdata`. Legacy code did
#'   not allow you to name the column and `Final_Sample_Size` was hard coded in
#'   the function.
#' @return
#' A long data frame of weights for each grouping structure. Columns identifying
#' the grouping structures will come first, followed by columns with sample
#' sizes per group by sex category. The documentation for these sample size
#' columns is sparse because this function is set to be deprecated next cycle
#' and replaced with a simplified path to writing composition data. But,
#' information is present for males (abbreviated with an M), females
#' (abbreviated with an F), unsexed (abbreviated with a U). If no sex is
#' provided then it is assumed all are unsexed and will be returned as such.
