#' Write out composition data formatted for Stock Synthesis
#'
#' Write out composition data to a file, binning the data as specified to work
#' in a Stock Synthesis model. Note, that this function does not work for
#' conditional age-at-length data because it is assumed that one would not want
#' to estimate growth in that way from fishery-dependent data.
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @param inComps A dataframe returned from [getComps()].
#' @param fname A filename with the appropriate extension, used to save the
#'   function output to the disk. For example, `LenComps.csv` or
#'   `file.path(getwd(), "LenComps.csv")`. Full, relative, or simple paths are
#'   allowed because the argument is used as is, i.e., not redirected to a
#'   directory different than [getwd()]. Note that various functions within
#'   pacfintools have different default values for this input argument. If
#'   `NULL` in `writeComps`, then no csv file will be written to disk.
#' @param abins,lbins Deprecated as of 0.2.10 to reduce complication in the code and
#'   make it more intuitive for the user when running this function.
#'   The binning structure to use for ages and lengths. For
#'   both arguments, the default is `NULL` which leads to the natural bins of
#'   the data being used, i.e., no additional binning is performed.
#' @param comp_bins The binning structure to use for ages and lengths.
#' @param column_with_input_n A string providing the column name with the
#'   appropriate value for the input sample size that will be given to Stock
#'   Synthesis as input_n (what we and {nwfscSurvey} provide as a column name)
#'   or NSamp (what Stock Synthesis wants as a name). The default is `"n_tows"`,
#'   which is the number of tows that were performed for the given
#'   stratifications passed to [getComps()] that created `inComps`. One might
#'   want to use `"n_fish"` or some column that you created yourself.
#' @param month Month for all observations. Defaults to 7. If input has multiple
#'   seasons, this must be a vector of equal length to the maximum seasons where
#'   the order of months in the vector will be assigned to season in ascending
#'   order. For example, if there  are two seasons and the month = c(1, 7)
#'   season 1 will be assigned to month 1 and season 2 to month 7.
#' @param partition  Used by Stock Synthesis for length- or age-composition data
#'   where 0 = retained + discarded, 1 = discarded, and 2 = retained fish. The
#'   default is to assume that these fish are retained only. The default was
#'   changed in 2020 from a value of 0, and code should be updated accordingly
#'   if you really want 0.
#' @param ageErr Defaults to 1 to use the first ageing error matrix specified in
#'   your Stock Synthesis model.
#' @param digits Integer indicating the number of decimal places to round value
#'   to (value is passed to [round()]). The default is 4, which will lead to
#'   rounding to four digits. If you do not want to round the results, then use
#'   `Inf`, which will lead to the use of R's default precision.
#' @param maxAge Deprecated as of 0.2.10 to reduce complication in the code and
#'   make it more intuitive for the user when running this function. All fish
#'   present in `inComps` will be binned according to the bins provided or the
#'   bins present.
#' @param dummybins Deprecated as of version 0.2.10 because you can just run the
#'   function with different `abins` or `lbins` rather than this function
#'   changing the first and end bin for you. The original default, years ago was
#'   `TRUE`, then it was changed to `FALSE`. Now, without this argument, it is
#'   essentially `FALSE`.
#' @param sum1 Deprecated as of version 0.2.10 because SS3 will normalize the
#'   composition data for you and thus it does not need to be done here. The
#'   previous default was `FALSE` so the removal of this argument does not
#'   change the default behavior of this function.
#' @param overwrite Deprecated as of version 0.2.10. The file will be
#'   automatically overwritten if present.
#' @inheritParams cleanPacFIN
#'
#' @details
#'
#'   The structure of the input dataframe determines whether the results
#'   produce age- or length-composition data. As of version 0.2.10, conditional
#'   age-at-length compositions are no longer available within this function.
#'
#'   Composition data are raw weights rather than proportions. Stock Synthesis
#'   internally converts these to proportions.  The raw weights should be
#'   examined for anomalies. To create proportions use [prop.table()] on the
#'   columns containing composition data.
#'
#'   The columns in the output preceding 'lengthcm' or 'Age' are those that
#'   were used in stratifying the data.
#' @return
#' A data frame is returned and a `.csv` is created and written to the disk with
#' the same data frame.
